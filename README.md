# Tariff_plans
Megaline is a federal mobile operator. Clients are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money.  It is necessary to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. The data of 500 Megaline users is available: who they are, where they are from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.
